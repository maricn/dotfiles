# mpv configurations
#
# for mpv v0.21.0 or newer with vapoursynth, ffms2, subliminal 
# and mvtools (last change, 30 october 2016)
#
# for macOS Sierra.
#
# you can copy all of this file into ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf
#
# the other necessary config files are also included inside, but commented out.
# you need to copy them into their own files as instructed and comment out
# the lines as you like.
#

#
# input settings
#
# input settings live in ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
# 
# first four lines disable trackpad swiping, otherwise mpv sometimes detects trackpad 
# gestures as commands and creates a mess. this fixes it. clicking still works.
# 
# AXIS_UP    ignore
# AXIS_DOWN  ignore
# AXIS_LEFT  ignore
# AXIS_RIGHT ignore
#
# following disables mpv's fullscreen controls and leaves it for 
# os x's window manager. this way, you can use native os x fullscreen
# but there would be no trackpad shortcuts. you can use window buttons without these
# too, but i find that double clicking to fullscreen usually happens reflexively,
# so i disabled it. you can still use *f* shortcut for mpv's native fullscreen.
#
# MOUSE_BTN0_DBL ignore
#
# following line makes open source vapoursynth solution optional, more about it later.
#
# P vf toggle vapoursynth=~/.config/mpv/vapoursynth/interpolation.py
#
# following line enables and disables bs2b, a filter to turn sound into
# binaural, which improves listening with headphones. ffmpeg must be installed
# with --with-libbs2b to use this.
#
# H af toggle lavfi=[bs2b=profile=jmeier]
#

#
# OSC settings
#
# on screen control settings live in ~/.config/mpv/lua-settings/osc.conf
#
# valign line carries the osc to the top of the screen so that it would 
# not cover the subtitles. others are self-explanatory. you also might 
# like to check the manual for additional layout and seekbar styles. 
# the ones i used are the most minimalistic ones. if you want OSC to
# show only when you hover over it, change deadzonesize to 1.
#
# layout=topbar
# hidetimeout=1000

# enable the line below if you are using svp 4 mac. afterwards you can 
# use vapoursynth presets or the svp preset.

#
# video
#
# while the highest quality preset is the best quality we can 
# get without 60 fps, it will kill your cpu with older retina screens and 
# macbook airs. therefore we have other presets too. use the high with 
# macbook air and the medium with older retina screens.
#
# important thing to note here is that we have seperate presets for
# 60 fps playback with vapoursynth solutions. the usual presets are too demanding 
# on cpu and vapoursynth can't work well with them. if you want to use 
# vapoursynth, just disable all the others and enable the ones below. the
# difference between high and medium is debanding. low uses a faster
# scaling algorithm compared to medium.
#
# there is also special svp presets. one for svp's own scaling, one for
# mpv's scaling. 
#
# if you want to use vapoursynth or svp other presets, you need to disable
# video-sync to remove mpv's interpolation. removing debanding might also 
# help quite a lot.
#
# remember that mpv uses its own frame interpolation in non-vapoursynth
# presets. it isn't real 60 fps, but still good. and sometimes works better
# with films. if you want to use one of those presets, but without interpolation,
# leave video-sync line commented out. that would disable the interpolation.
# check the link below for more information:
#
# < https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/Interpolation >

# non-vapoursynth, high quality preset is the default one. 
# if you have problems, downgrade one-by-one.

#
# enable the *videotoolbox-format* line for older macbooks, no clean-cut

# scripts
#
# mpv can load lua scripts to do various things, here is a compendium
# of some scripts: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/user-scripts
#
# scripts are installed under ~/.config/mpv/scripts
#

#script=~/.config/mpv/scripts/mvtools.vpy
# script=~/.config/mpv/scripts/autosub.lua,~/.config/mpv/scripts/autoload.lua,~/.config/mpv/scripts/stats.lua
# script=~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpv-open-letterboxd-page/open-letterboxd-page.lua,
# script=~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpv-autosub/autosub.lua

#
# stats.lua -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slyneth/mpv-stats/master/stats.lua
#
# displays some statistics about the currently played file on-screen with *i* key.
#
# autoload.lua -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpv-player/mpv/master/tools/lua/autoload.lua
#
# automatically loads playlist entries before and after the currently
# playing file, by scanning the directory.
#
# this is the script ~/.config/mpv/scripts/autosub.lua :
#
# this script downloads subtitles automatically using
# subliminal. to search subtitles, use the key b. you change subtitles
# with j and open/close them with v. if you want to change the subtitle
# language, change en in the t.args line.
#
# local utils = require 'mp.utils'
# function load_sub_fn()
#     subl = "/usr/local/bin/subliminal" -- use 'which subliminal' to find the path
#     mp.msg.info("searching subtitle")
#     mp.osd_message("searching subtitle")
#     t = {}
#     t.args = {subl, "download", "-s", "-l", "en", mp.get_property("path")}

#         mp.msg.info("subtitle download succeeded")
#         mp.osd_message("subtitle download succeeded")

#

#
# misc.
#
# save-position-on-quit will save the current playback position on quit.
# when this file is played again later, the player will seek to the old 
# playback position on start. works with streaming too.
#
# we use .jpg with screenshots because .png takes to much space. if you want
# to use .png disable the screenshot-jpeg-quality line and set screenshot-format
# to png.
#
# input-media-keys controls whether or not mpv will have control over media
# keys. set it to *yes* if you want to use them with mpv.
#
# cache-default determines how much of the video file will be cached
# while streaming. here it is set to 578.3 mbs. while this seems much, it is 
# actually just enough to cache 1080p anime episodes entirely so that you 
# could continue watching if you experience network problems.
#
# cache-pause pauses the playback when cache is empty, this is cleaner.
#
# cache-initial determines how long to wait before playback, filling
# the cache. these are all on kbs.
